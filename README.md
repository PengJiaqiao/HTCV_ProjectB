# Hot Topics in Computer Vision (Project B)
## "Autonomous Driving: Tell me what you are able to see!"

In this student project, an autonomous driving challenge – the parking pilot – will be analyzed in detail. Therefore, different sub-functions for parking lot recognition and status assessment (free, occupied) should be implemented. Data from different sensors shall be used to identify and extract features. With the help of data fusion, a provided map shall be verified and updated with free parking spaces.

The main challenge of the project is to deal with the characteristics of different sensors. What is each sensor able to “see”? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the sensors?
